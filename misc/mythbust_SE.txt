This tool (or use of a backup GenuineTicket.xml file) can allow you to escape Windows 11 SE (Student Edition, disputed, but internally known as "CloudEdition") as it changes the hardware activation.
After changing the product key to the generic key the ticket would list, it would activate the edition and get off of SE without reinstalling.
